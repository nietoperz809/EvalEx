Simple command line calculator for programmers
==============================================

Use x, b or o prefix to denote hex, bin or octal numbers.
Type 'ops' to see list of operators, or 'funcs' for functions.
Type 'hist' to see the history or 'rep' to re-evaluate the last term.
if 'rep' is followed by a number 'n' then history[n] will be re-evaluated.
To change the output, type 'radix n' where n can be from 2 to 36 inclusively
If radix is 0 then output is presented as real number, otherwise integer.
... or type any term - or 'bye' to exit ...
